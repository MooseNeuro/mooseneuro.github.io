title: "Multiscale modeling with MOOSE at 34th Annual Computational Neuroscience Meeting (CNS*2025), 5th July 2025 in Florence, Italy"
description: Join us at CNS 2025 for a one-day hands-on workshop on Multiscale Modeling with MOOSE. This workshop will introduce key theoretical concepts in neuroscience and systems biology, followed by practical, hands-on sessions using the MOOSE simulation environment. Participants will explore foundational biophysical and biochemical processes and learn how to model them at multiple scales. The sessions will feature advanced modeling techniques using MOOSEâ€™s Python interface, guiding you through building and simulating realistic neuronal models. See below for details and application.

The study of brain function spans a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Networks of thousands of neurons in the brain are influenced by channels and synapses whose properties can be controlled by biochemical reactions involving as few as tens of molecules. While electrical events in neurons occur at the timescale of milliseconds, neuromodulation can take minutes to days or longer, and memories can last a lifetime.

MOOSE, the Multiscale Object-Oriented Simulation Environment is a system designed to assist the study of such diverse scales in the brain. It can simulate stochastic and deterministic models of biochemical signaling pathways, biophysical neuron models with detailed morphology and ion channels, simplified point neuron models, and large networks of such neurons.

This workshop will be an introduction to multiscale modeling including theory and hands-on. The participants will get a brief overview of important biophysical and biochemical processes in the brain. This will be followed by exploration of these processes using the Python scripting interface
of MOOSE. The participants will be shown how to write Python code to set up and simulate simple biochemical reactions and signaling pathways, and biophysically realistic neuron models from scratch. They will also learn how to import existing models in standard formats into a MOOSE simulation. Finally, they will get an overview of the Rdesigneur tool in MOOSE and use it to tweak and simulate multiscale models that combine biochemical signaling pathways with biophysical models.
