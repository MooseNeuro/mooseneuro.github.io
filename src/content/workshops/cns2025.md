title: "Multiscale modeling with MOOSE at 34th Annual Computational Neuroscience Meeting (CNS*2025), July 5, 2025 in Florence, Italy"
description: "Join us at CNS 2025 for an in-depth, full-day tutorial on Multiscale Modeling with MOOSE. The objective of this tutorial is to introduce key theoretical concepts in neuroscience and systems biology,  with a strong emphasis on practical implementation through hands-on sessions using MOOSE.  In addition to tutorials on biophysical and biochemical models, we will present the latest features of MOOSE, including jardesigner, a newly developed, web-based graphical interface for multiscale modeling. The tutorial will demonstrate how jardesigner and MOOSE together can be used to develop as well as execute spiking neuron models, incorporating chemical signaling pathways involved in neuromodulation and synaptic plasticity on spines. See below for details and application"

The study of brain function spans a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Networks of thousands of neurons in the brain are influenced by channels and synapses whose properties can be controlled by biochemical reactions involving as few as tens of molecules. While electrical events in neurons occur at the timescale of milliseconds, neuromodulation can take minutes to days or longer, and memories can last a lifetime.

MOOSE, the Multiscale Object-Oriented Simulation Environment is a system designed to assist the study of such diverse scales in the brain. It can simulate stochastic and deterministic models of biochemical signaling pathways, biophysical neuron models with detailed morphology and ion channels, simplified point neuron models, and large networks of such neurons.

This workshop provides an introductory overview of multiscale modeling, combining theoretical background with hands-on training. Participants will begin with a concise introduction to key biophysical as well as biochemical processes with guided exercises on how to construct and simulate these models in MOOSE. We will also introduce participants to exploring these processes using Python scripting interface of MOOSE. In addition, the session will cover techniques for importing and integrating existing models in standard formats into MOOSE. The workshop will conclude with an introduction to _jardesigner_, a powerful, web-based graphical interface for multiscale modeling with MOOSE. Participants will use _jardesigner_ to modify and simulate multiscale models that integrate biochemical signaling with biophysical neuronal dynamics.

This session is intended for students, researchers, and practitioners interested in gaining practical skills in multiscale computational modeling in neuroscience
