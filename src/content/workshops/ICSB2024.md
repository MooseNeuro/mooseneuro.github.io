We are conducting a day-long hands-on workshop on MOOSE at the 23rd International Conference on Systems Biology. This workshop will introduce participants to the Multiscale Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE). MOOSE is a powerful simulation platform designed for computational modeling in neuroscience and systems biology, covering a wide range of scales from large neuronal networks to detailed reaction-diffusion systems.

Participants will begin by learning how to install MOOSE on their own machines. Following a brief overview of key biophysical and biochemical processes in the brain, they will be guided through the core features of MOOSE. The workshop will demonstrate how to write Python scripts for building and simulating models within the MOOSE framework. Hands-on exercises will include implementing simple biochemical reactions, signaling pathways, and biophysically realistic neuron models.

Finally, participants will be introduced to Rdesigneur, a tool within MOOSE that enables the simulation of multiscale models integrating biochemical signaling with biophysical neural dynamics.
